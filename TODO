Document code!

User should be able to:
	* List all newsgroups
	* Create and delete newsgroups
	* List articles in a newsgroup
	* Read, write and delete articles in a newsgroup
	* Any user can delete any newsgroups/articles

Content types (Stored on server):
	* Newsgroups(ID (Unique bigger than 0), Name (Unique), Article)
	* Articles(ID (Unique bigger than 0), Title, Author, Content)
	* User(Name)

Server requirements:
	* Two versions of the server:
		- One storing data to primary memory
		- One storing data on the disk
	* The one storing data to memory will lose all data on restart
	* The disk version remembers the data after reboot, changes to 
	  database are immediately reflected on disk
	* Order newsgroups/articles by date where oldest comes first
	* Clients not following the protocol are immediately disconnected
	* If there is an error that the server cannot handle (it should try to
	  handle them all) it should quit with an informative error message

Client requirements:
	* The client reads commands form the terminal, sends them to the server,
	  and displays results on the terminal
	* It should be easy to use and self-explanatory
	* If there is an error that the client cannot handle (it should try to
	  handle them all) it should quit with an informative error message
